<h1> FlatGame - Mod4 React Project </h1> 

<p> This project was made during module 4 at Flatiron School. The project specs were to build something using React with a Ruby on Rails backend. This was a pair project made in 5 days and presented to the office on the last day.</p>

<h3> Features and code </h3>

<p> The project allows users to browse two hundred popular games. They can see their rating out of 100. A picture of the game and its genre's. Games can be sorted by genre, title, rating and search term. Any and all of these can work in tandem. </p>
<p> Users can click on a game to see previous comments others have left and add there own. These persist in the backend.<p>
<p> Two API's were chosen and then discarded before arriving at the final one. This was because we encountered many problems and thought it would save time in the long run. Some of the code in the frontend/services/api file is legacy and serves only to show what we can and have built. </p>
<p> We decided to pull games from an API that held tens of thousands of games, however when we tried to pull down more than two hundred it did not work, which is why we have a smallish amount. We did however in testing find that all the popular games at the moment were on there.</p>
 
<h3> Stretch goals </h3>

<p> Persisting star ratings, possibly have the star ratings affect the score the user see's.</p>
